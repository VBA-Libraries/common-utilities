I am Bhanu, I am a professional VBA developer. I have pledged to create 365 vba reusable functions in 365 days by 10th April 2020.
The functions will increase productivity of vba developers.

Support me creating VBA code snippets and make life easier for VBA programmer like us.
Be part of the journey to create a VBA library that can perform all kinds of tasks with one line of code.
Your help will motivate me to achieve my goal of creating 365 reusable VBA functions. You can help me in the following ways
1. Contributing to the code
2. By becoming a Patrion
3. Testing the code in different office version and operating system

If you need support implementing any VBA code, check my patreon page.

Happy Codding!
